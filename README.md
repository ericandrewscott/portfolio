# Eric Scott â€” in brief (not ðŸ©²)

Greetings, humans ðŸ§” and friendly robots ðŸ¤–!
Iâ€™m Eric, a UX/Design Engineer who has been happily lost at the intersection of design and code for 18+ years. My natural habitat? Design systems, frontend engineering, and workflow automation. Tools of choice: React, TypeScript, Node.js, GraphQL, and the occasional wizardry with Figma plugins.

Recently, Iâ€™ve been diving deep into AI-driven design systemsâ€”building pipelines that can literally take a spec and spit out usable assets like TypeScript interfaces, CSS stylesheets, or even a Figma plugin that generates ready-to-go component sets. Think: spec â†’ button, with no detours.

In short, Iâ€™m a bridge-builder: part diplomat (designers <-> engineers), part mad scientist ðŸ§ª (multi-brand ecosystems, semantic markup, build tooling). If it helps teams move faster and keeps frontends looking sharp, chances are Iâ€™m already hacking on it.
